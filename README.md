### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Interestingly enough i didnt encounter as many challenges as i thought i would. But however one hiccup i had was when i was implementing a non hard-coded handling of the image sizes for my backdrop and poster i had to search online and i found a line that worked for me which was <strong> android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" </ strong>
